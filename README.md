(Under progress)

# Monthly Book Recommendations
This is just a fun little personal project. I used to love reading, but lately have dropped the habit.
So, I figured, hey, let's make a website where I will be sharing the books I have started reading.
This way, I can be held more accountable since my reading progress is out there for the world to see ðŸ‘€. The book list will be updated every month, and I will be adding more features as I go along.
